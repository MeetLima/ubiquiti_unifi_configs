# Ubiquiti Unifi Configs
Configuration file samples for the Ubiquiti Unifi series of products.

These documents are samples for various Ubiquiti Unifi products. I've created them to help new users with the Ubiquiti Unifi products. Please submit updates and changes. Patches are welcome. There are no comments in any of the files as comments are not supported in JSON. Please see the descriptions below. Using the CLI of the various devices and some Google searching for available commands can help as well.
