# Ubiquiti Controller Configs
Configuration file samples for the Ubiquiti Controller product.

These documents are samples for the Ubiquiti Controller. They are usually located in the site data directory on the controller. On the Unifi Cloud Key controller, the directory is usually **/usr/lib/unifi/data/sites/default**

The file must always be called **config.properties** and there is only one file allowed. Documentation on this file is linked below.
